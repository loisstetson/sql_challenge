## 2) Data Engineering
Perform data engineering tasks based on available information to design table schemas for all six CSV files. Remember to define appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other necessary constraints. Ensure that the tables are created in a sequential order that accommodates foreign key relationships.

Subsequently, import the data from each CSV file into its respective SQL table.
